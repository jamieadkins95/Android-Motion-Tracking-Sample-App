# Android-Motion-Tracking-Sample-App
Android N introduced a new [6DoF sensor type](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_POSE_6DOF) that allows applications to retrieve motion trackign data from devices that support it. This application shows how to use the new sensor data to create an Augmented Reality app.

Please note that no mobile device currently supports the 6DoF sensor.

Based on the Tango Augmented Reality Example found [here](https://github.com/googlesamples/tango-examples-java).

Also contains a tango product flavour that will build the application using tango pose data instead of android sensor pose data. Requires a Tango compatible app.
